# 🌵 Desert Runner — Crossroads of Sand

# Play it here: https://desert-runner-still-loading.netlify.app/

Desert Runner is a web-based endless runner game built by our team for a game jam event. Unlike many game jam entries that use engines like Unity or Godot, this game was made from scratch using only web technologies — HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — with no game engines or external frameworks.

# 🛠️ Built With

This project was developed using core web development technologies, including:

HTML5 — Game structure and rendering

CSS3 — Styling and responsive layout

JavaScript (Vanilla) — Game logic, input handling, and animation

Three.js- for 3d rendering

WebGL- animations, texture and design

Typescript

Tailwind CSS

No game engines or libraries were used — everything was coded manually to maximize learning and flexibility.

(Adjust this section based on the actual controls you implemented.)

# 📦 How to Run Locally

If you want to play or develop further locally:

Clone the repository

git clone 


Open index.html in your browser
(No server needed — the game runs locally using standard browser APIs.)

(Optional) If you use modules or advanced JS features, you can launch a local server:

npx serve


or similar.

# 👥 Team Credits

This game was created by me and @SimplyDilisha during a game jam. We collaborated on all aspects of design, development, and deployment of this project.

# ⭐ Why This Matters

Making a playable game using just HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Web Dev (without engines) is a great way to deepen your understanding of:

Browser rendering and the game loop

Keyboard input handling

Collision logic

Responsive design

Browser games like this run right in the web browser, which means anyone can play without downloads or installs — a classic benefit of HTML5 browser games.
